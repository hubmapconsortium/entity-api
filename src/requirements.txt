# Note: we don't need this dependency. But due to the recent unit test error: 
# ImportError: cannot import name 'json' from 'itsdangerous'
# The recommended fix is to upgrade the Flask to latest version i.e, 2.0.3 or above
# But we don't want to upgrade Flask in case it breaks the API
# Add this itsdangerous dependency and downgrade to 2.0.1 as a temporary solution
itsdangerous==2.0.1
